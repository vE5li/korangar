Korangar is a next-gen Ragnarok Online client written in Rust. It features real-time lighting with drop shadows. It adds a completely new and very customizable user interface and removes limitations of the official client, such as the fixed aspect ratio. It also supports Linux, Windows and MacOS!

## 📦 Packages

We try to keep the project as modular as possible by splitting the codebase into individual crates. All the crates prefixed with `ragnarok-` are **independent of Korangar and have no dependencies on it**.

We encourage everyone to use these crates for their own Ragnarok Online related projects and contribute back if they want to.
