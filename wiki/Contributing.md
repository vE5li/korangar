# Developing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Korangar is purely a reverse engineering project. We **_do not_** allow any code that has been taken from or inspired by GRAVITY's intellectual property.

### 🚩 Issues
We have [some issues](https://github.com/vE5li/korangar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) specifically for people wanting to contribute. Most of them are relatively small issues that (hopefully) offer a good introduction into the code base.

### 🧪 Tests
Although there are no issues regarding this, Korangar is severely lacking when it comes to tests of any sort. We wouldn't expect anyone to write tests but if you want to we are very thankful!

### 📝 Style
The entire project is formatted using [Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt). Additionally, please make sure that all commit messages start with a capital letter. Other than that we don't have any specific rules on coding style but we strive to keep the look and feel of the code consistent.
