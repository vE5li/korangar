Korangar is a next-gen Ragnarok Online client written in Rust. It features real-time lighting with drop shadows and a dynamic day-night cycle. It adds a completely new and very customizable user interface and removes limitations of the official client, such as the fixed aspect ratio. It also supports Linux, Windows and MacOS!

### Project structure

#### Note: All the `ragnarok-*` crates are meant to be independent from Korangar and have no dependencies to it, meaning they can be used for other Ragnarok Online related projects.
