# Ragnarok Procedural

A proc macro crate to derive Ragnarok Online traits.

All the `ragnarok-*` crates are meant to be independent from Korangar and have no dependencies to it, meaning they can be used for other Ragnarok Online related projects.

## Note

This crate is not supposed to be included directly. Use it by activating the `derive` feature of `ragnarok_bytes` or `ragnarok_packets`.
