Korangar is a Ragnarok Online client written in Rust using Vulkan. It features real-time lighting with drop shadows and a dynamic day-night cycle. It adds a completely new and very customizable user interface and removes limitations of the official client, such as the fixed aspect ratio. It also supports Linux, Windows and MacOS!
