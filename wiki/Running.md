# Requirements
In order to run the client, you will need to get the `data.grf` and `rdata.grf` from the official kRO client. Place them both inside the `korangar` directory (`korangar/korangar`) and start the client using the commands shown in the (Installation)[Installation.md] section, swapping out `build` for `run`. For example:

```fish
cargo run --release --features debug
```

# Game servers

### ðŸ”“ Remote server
By default, Korangar will try to connect to a remote rAthena instance that we host for development purposes. Since it is intended to be used for testing, we have modified it to make everyone's life easier. These changes include:
- No packet obfuscation, meaning the network traffic is unencrypted
- Anyone can use @-commands from the instant they are placed into the tutorial
- Deleting characters does not require any wait time or confirmation

### ðŸ”’ Local server
You can also tell Korangar to connect to a server on your local machine by editing `sclientinfo.xml` in `korangar/archive/data/`. Just duplicate one of the existing entries and replace the server IP and name. If you are interested in setting up a server locally I suggest reading the [install instructions](https://github.com/rathena/rathena#2-installation) on the rAthena GitHub page. If you are comfortable reading Nix coder you can also check out [korangar-rathena](https://github.com/vE5li/korangar-rathena), which is the repository containing the configuration of the development server (including all patches and settings).

# Logging in
If everything starts correctly, you should see a window prompting you for a username and a password. You can create a new user by entering your desired username with the suffix `_m` or `_f` (for `male` and `female` respectively) and your desired password. _Hint_: remember to remove the `_*` suffix the next time you want to log in to your account.

> [!WARNING]
> Please don't use any of your usual credentials as we will be able to see them in the database. They will also be saved in _**plain text**_ in the client folder if you tick the boxes during login.

### ðŸ«€ Creating a character
After logging in, you will be able to create a new character. If the character creation fails, it might be because you are using invalid characters in the name (e.g. `_`).

# Troubleshooting
If the client keeps crashing or you have any other problems, please consult the wiki page on [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).
